## Project Overview

This project focuses on applying Monte Carlo simulation techniques to price two types of financial derivatives:

1. European Call Option  
2. Arithmetic Asian Call Option *(Path-dependent)*  

The goal is to evaluate Monte Carlo valuation performance under different payoff structures and compare results with closed-form benchmarks such as the Black–Scholes model where applicable.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Implement Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing  
- Recognize differences between standard and path-dependent derivatives  
- Validate simulation results against analytical solutions  
- Observe convergence behavior under increased simulation paths
